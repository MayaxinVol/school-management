I just checked your requirements, carefully.

I have some questions.

1. Firstly, I want to know the correct meaning of iq option and binary.

2. Do you need to develop a project from the first? If true, what should I use as a front end framework? or do you have the similar template?

As the back end, do you want to use PHP, only?

In addition, importing text files or Excel files, editing and associating them with databases is not a problem.

3. Finally, can you offer the detail info of the company that need, such as the image, design, and so on before the development?

If I have the correct answer from you, I can start the development according to your requirements, at once.

And I am sure that I can offer cool result that you want.
